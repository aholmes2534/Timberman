This is a game made using C++, centred around the SFML library. 
I made this game while following the textbook - "Beginning C++ Game Programming" by John Horton. 
At the time of this repo's creation, I'm back after more than a year's break from programming and am refreshing my skills so that I can work on new projects and stuff...
